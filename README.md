# Springboard data science taster course notebooks

## worked_notebooks
Contain the worked example notebooks that include completed code.

## source_notebooks
These are sourced from worked_notebooks but have had the assignment
code deleted and output cleared.
Students will load these notebooks and work from them. They can, if
and when they choose, refer to the original notebooks in worked_notebooks
to check their answers or get unstuck.
